Comparison of objective rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example show the well-known spurious oscillations that can occur in the
Zaremba-Jauman rate when simulating elastic responses under large transformations.
The results are compared with the Green-Naghdi and logarithmic Xiao-Meyers-Bruhns rates,
which do not exhibit such oscillations.

We first consider an material with isotropic elastic behavior defined by its Young modulus
and Poisson ratio. The material is subjected to a large simple shear deformation.
Not that of course this example is only illustrative since for large deformations
elastic materials are not physically meaningful.

In here the the three objective rates are compared : Jaumann, Green-Naghdi and Logarithmic

Note that the loading path is described in the file `path.txt` :
Here the Control_type(NLGEOM) has the value 5, which means that
the transformation gradient is passed a a kinematical loading path in the file.

The simulation therefore consists in a simple shear up to a shear transformation of 5.0
time is set to 5 seconds, with 100 increments, so that time matches the value of the shear transformation.

Note that the Jaumann rate exhibits spurious oscillations in the stress and strain response,
while the Green-Naghdi and Logarithmic rates provide smooth responses.
This is a well-known issue with the Jaumann rate when dealing with large simple shear transformation.
The Green-Naghdi and Logarithmic rates do not suffer from this problem, making them more suitable
for simulations involving large deformations and rotations.

While logarithmic rates are often considered the most accurate for large deformations,
please note that the induced rotation is however not correct. Only the Green-Naghdi rate provides the exact rotation
for rigid body motions corresponding to the RU (or VR) decomposition.
